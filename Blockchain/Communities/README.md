# Blockchain Roadmap


## Get strted with Blockchain
- Blockchain is a continuously expanding ledger that maintains a secure, chronological, and immutable record of every transaction that has ever occurred.

- This roadmap will get you started with absolute basics to advanced concepts like ethereum concepts, SDK's etc.
