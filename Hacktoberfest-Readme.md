## **What is Hacktoberfest ?**
Hacktoberfest is a month long event hosted by DigitalOcean for the 9th year in a row, Hacktoberfest encourages participation in giving back to the open source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source projects.
It is open to everyone in the community and anyone whether you're a seasoned contributor or looking to contributing for the first time, you are welcome. 

## **Things you should know to participate 🤔:**
- Register anytime between September 26 and October 31.
- Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic).
- Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total.
- Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest.
- The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
